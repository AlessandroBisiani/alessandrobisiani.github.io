<h3>TRANSFERABLE SKILLS</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I prefer to begin by thinking abstractly about a problem’s functional components, which helps me focus on efficient resolutions and designing.</li>
	<li>Taking responsibility for the smooth accomplishment and reporting of implicit and explicit goals, and defining short term requirements and deadlines for the fulfillment of those goals. For example: independently developing my application to carry out reinforcement learning experiments, or running the bar depending on all contingencies including staff propensities, daily bookings, daily limitations due to breakages or shortages, pre-set goals, etc.</li>
	<li>Working in a small team at FinPro, I took advantage of the environment to develop my communication skills and effective teamwork. I will always benefit from being able to interact with others regarding the work I am doing, independently of the size of the working unit. Creating a database-driven website with a team of fellow students confirmed this: touching base with the team several times a day emphasized the advantages of pooled resources, maintaining focus, and effective scheduling, to maximizing individual potential.</li>
	<li>Before applying for my Computer Science degree I began learning Python and Java. I also sought information on computer architecture. This initiative put me ahead of the course content in the Programming in Java and Systems Architecture modules. Also when at FinPro it was necessary that I picked up skills quickly and fully met task specifications while doing so.</li>
